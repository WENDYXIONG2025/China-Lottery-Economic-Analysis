This project analyses the spatial distribution of lottery outlets across all 340 prefecture-level cities in China, exploring how population, GDP, and urban hierarchy influence outlet density.
Data were manually collected from digital maps and analysed using Python, Stata, and Excel.

Lottery_Analysis_Results.xlsx – This file contains the complete dataset used for the analysis, including:

The number of lottery outlets for each province and prefecture-level city in China.

Provincial population and GDP data for normalization and socioeconomic comparison.

Calculated metrics and analytical results, such as outlet density, GDP-per-outlet ratios, correlation coefficients, and regression outputs.

⚙️ Methods

Data Tools: Python (pandas, statsmodels, geopandas), Stata, Excel

Analyses: Descriptive statistics, OLS regression, correlation, clustering (K-means), Gini and CV indices

Metric: Density of outlets per 10,000 residents (DPI)

📊 Key Insights

Population size is the strongest driver of outlet count, stronger than GDP.

Coastal provinces have dense and balanced networks; inland areas show capital-city dominance.

Reveals “strong vs. weak provincial capitals” patterns across China’s urban system.
